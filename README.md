Engineering skill deveolopment project

#This Project was done for the Engineering skills development ;Semester 2 Module of 
Computer science and Engineering department of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. (19 Batch)

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation, universities were closed in Sri Lanka. That forced us to carry out distance learning and teaching. This database management system will lead the undergraduates and academic staff to proceed with the correspondence on their scholarly matters over the progressing pandemic situation. When moving the implementation from paper works to an online system, a well-designed system will be considerably more efficient and sustainable. As future professionals in the computer science industry, we here are attempting to discover a solution to the above-discussed issue.

For this software tool, we included the following features.
● If a student or staff member has not an account can create their user accounts, else log into the system by their username and password.
● Students can send requests to academic staff on matters such as late add/drop requests, extend assignment submission deadlines, repeat exams as the first attempt with the next batch, etc.
● Academic staff members can select, sort and filter, approve or decline, request missing information of each student’s request.
● All comments regarding a given request are shown in a single thread.
